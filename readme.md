Floating space scooter

Introduction:
- The Scooter has been send to space and is just floating around there, because of the radiation and gravity is the scooter constant deforming.

Interactions:
- Changing the different radiations sorts:
Arrow up / Arrow down = (changing the colors of the scooter)

- Movement Controls to float:
W = floating straight forward
A = floating to the left
S = floating straight backwards
D = floating to the right
Shift = floating down
Space = floating up

How the project works:
- I embedded my own Blender model (the scooter) into a ThreeJS environment and added 2 different shaders, one shaders is causing the space like 3d environment and the second shader is causing the scooter to deform and changing colors.
